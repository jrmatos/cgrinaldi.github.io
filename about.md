My name is Chris Rinaldi and I am very interested in leveraging data to help make the world a better place. My past experience has been on the data side, using predictive modeling and analysis. Lately I've been interested in building applications that leverage data to help improve the user's experience.

In this blog, I'll be documenting my time at [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com), a 13 week programming bootcamp that focuses on web development. I am very excited about this journey, and I hope you will join me!

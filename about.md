My name is Chris Rinaldi and I am very interested in leveraging data to help make the world a better place. My past experience has been on the data side, using predictive modeling and analysis to combat weapons proliferation, narcotics smuggling, and terrorism. I am currently interested in merging my machine learning experience with software development in order to build applications that leverage user data in powerful ways.

If you have any questions, comments, or just wish to talk, feel free to email me at cgrinaldi [at] gmail.com!

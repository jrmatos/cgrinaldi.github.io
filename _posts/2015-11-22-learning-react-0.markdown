Lately I've been interested in learning React. Part of my interest stems from the fact that I've only really used Angular for frontend development and I want to diversify my skill set. The other reason is that there is a functional aspect to it that seems really interesting. But the real reason is that I want to get better at learning new things in the world of development. Technologies come and go at a rapid pace, and I want to ensure that I have a way to keep up with the flood.

[Deliberate Practice](http://expertenough.com/1423/deliberate-practice) is the idea that to get better at a particular skill, you have to practice in a specific way. It is not as simple as practicing for 10,000 hours (an idea popularized by Malcolm Gladwell's [Outliers: The Story of Success](http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930)). Instead the quality of how you practice matters immensely. What you are learning should be at the boundary of your current abilities, forcing you to push yourself.

For this and the following posts, I'm hoping to learn React through a series of deliberate practice projects. In addition, I want to have a better understanding of how the [Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) fits in, since any serious application needs a structured way of managing data.

I'm currently envisioning the following mini-projects:

0. Setting up a build process for React
1. Basic Todo App w/o Flux
2. Todo App w/ Flux
3. Todo App w/ [Reflux](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs)
3. Todo App w/ [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
4. Reflections

My hope is that by completing the above projects, I'll get a better sense of how to actually use React for real applications.

You might think that the Todo app is overly simplistic, but in light of my focus on learning React and Flux, it makes sense to do. I'll be able to compare my implementations to existing ones, providing me a source of feedback that will help me improve. I've identified the following examples that I'll be comparing my work to:

- [React Todo App](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/react)
- [React + Flux Todo App](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/todo-list.html)
- [React + Reflux Todo App](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs-todo)
- [React + Redux Todo App](https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc)

Hello!

Today I am playing around with using <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a> to see if I can auto email people who have subscribed to my blog when (and if!) I actually post something.

Currently, I have a total of two people on my list. Myself (using the awesome trick of <a href="mailto:cgrinaldi+mailchimp@gmail.com">cgrinaldi+mailchimp@gmail.com</a>) and my wife...so not quite the raging subscription list most bloggers would like, but hey, you have to start somewhere!

Currently I am using a blogging platform called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which is an awesome way to create a blog using a combination of technologies that include HTML, CSS, and the <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid templating language</a>. While you don't have to use <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> to host your blog, it is a very easy (and free!) way to do so. In fact, the creator of Github, Tom Preston-Werner, created Jekyll as a simple, yet powerful, alternative to Wordpress and the other traditional CMS platforms. If all you care about is writing content, then I think Jekyll is the way to go.

The great thing about using Jekyll is that it creates statically generated content, which means that it doesn't rely on any databases or other expensive calls to services that can slow your blog down. Instead, every time I upload the latest state of my blog (written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdownmarkdown">Markdown</a>) to Github, it will automatically be converted into the necessary HTML and CSS files that are needed to display it properly in the browser. As a bonus, the entire blog is version controlled, so I can experiment with different styles without worrying about losing critical code.

Now let's see if this post is automatically sent to my wife...

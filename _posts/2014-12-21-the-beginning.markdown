summary:    The one where I start my blog by writing about my blog.

Hello!

My name is Chris Rinaldi, and I am doing something I have rarely ever done before. I am typing into my computer, thinking that someone (most likely just future me!) will actually read this. Seriously, why would anyone waste their time reading my random thoughts when there are literally billions of other web sites out there that they could be wasting their time on (I highly recommend <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/cats">Reddit</a>)?

I've decided that despite my cynical attitude, I should give it a go and try to actually contribute something to someone that is hopefully not myself. I've been consuming others' content for so long, that I think it is about time that I try and add something to the conversation. I don't have that much experience in the blogosphere, so I apologize for the lack of structure, poor word choice, and other grammatical errors I will surely make, but hopefully there will be something useful in my writing :).

In this blog, I'll be documenting my journey through <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a>, a 13 week programming bootcamp in San Francisco. I'll have future posts explaining how I settled on this course of action, and my experience thus far, but for the time being I hope you'll join me on what is sure to be an adventure!
